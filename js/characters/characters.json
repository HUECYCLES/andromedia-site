With his endless charisma, he can turn any situation thrown at him into an spectacle, while overworked employees suffer behind the scenes.\n\nOnce Kris opened the fountain, M.I.K.E. knew it was time to make them wish they would've carried out their little plan earlier. Maybe they can learn a thing or two about what it's like to fulfill someone else's legacy...",

Odeion knows everything there is to old-fashioned cinema and theater, and has an unique gift of displaying and controlling memories.\n\nHis objective is to make sure Kris and their friends traverse safely through the Metropolis, while avoiding trouble with M.I.K.E. There is, however, a lingering sadness that radiates through him, but it seems he will never tell you about any of that.",

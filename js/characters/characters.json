With his endless charisma, he can turn any situation thrown at him into an spectacle, while overworked employees suffer behind the scenes.\n\nOnce Kris opened the fountain, M.I.K.E. knew it was time to make them wish they would've carried out their little plan earlier. Maybe they can learn a thing or two about what it's like to fulfill someone else's legacy...",

Odeion knows everything there is to old-fashioned cinema and theater, and has an unique gift of displaying and controlling memories.\n\nHis objective is to make sure Kris and their friends traverse safely through the Metropolis, while avoiding trouble with M.I.K.E. There is, however, a lingering sadness that radiates through him, but it seems he will never tell you about any of that.",

One day, she left the monotony of her job to try her luck in Rook Technologies as an intern.\n\nAs things went wrong, and with a strange force seemingly guiding her, Halojack had turned to broadcast hijacking as a way to spread deranged messages across Telehaven.\n\nAfter being fired and pursued, her reign of terror had finally faded into obscurity, even though some swear they can catch strange signal intrusions from the corner of their eyes.",

Her sacred power comes from a strong prayer to a loved one's safety, and once she sees Noelle, the pieces start to fit together.",

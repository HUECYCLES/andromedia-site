				[Gif of Kris, Susie, Noelle and Berdly carving pumpkins.

				Technically this is the second newsletter in our arsenal, but here's a proper greeting... HELLO!
			</p>
			<p>
				This marks the start of our seasonal newsletters that we release "whenever we want during the season" or
				if there's substantial progress with the projects. We felt this was necessary to keep fans of the project
				engaged and also to give you guys some news from time to time, no matter how small they may be.
			</p>
			<p>So let's get into it!</p>

				We are making TONS of progress on the Andromedia Chapters 3-7 project.
				Seriously, you should see our Github push activity!
				With this, we're getting closer and closer to releasing the actual installments of the series,
				and maybe even somel playable secret fights somewhere down the road (kind of a big maybe).
			</p>
			<p>
				We're slowly but surely implementing new mechanics and gimmicks for each chapter,
				which are fitting with their themes. I'm not sure where Toby got the idea that a teacup ride
				is somehow fitting with an internet themed Dark World... but hey!
				Who's to defy the dog?
			</p>
			<p>In Andromedia, we're not trying to be the dog anyways...</p>

			<h2 class="center">More Progress...?!</h2>
			<p>
				We've made substantial progress in recreating Castle Town's mechanics and locations for the different chapters!
				At least one expansion map for Castle Town was made for Chapter 3, and we've pretty much completed the Cafe Placement
				mechanic + Dojo Challenges menu as well.
			</p>
			<p>I have to thank a few people on the Kristal server for all the help...</p>

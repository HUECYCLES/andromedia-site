				Technically this is the second newsletter in our arsenal, but here's a proper greeting... HELLO!
			</p>
			<p>
				This marks the start of our seasonal newsletters that we release "whenever we want during the season" or
				if there's substantial progress with the projects. We felt this was necessary to keep fans of the project
				engaged and also to give you guys some news from time to time, no matter how small they may be.
			</p>
			<p>So let's get into it!</p>
			<p class="center">

			<p>
				We are making TONS of progress on the Andromedia Chapters 3-7 project.
				Seriously, you should see our Github push activity!
				With this, we're getting closer and closer to releasing the actual installments of the series,
				and maybe even some playable secret fights somewhere down the road (kind of a big maybe).
			</p>
			<p>
				We're slowly but surely implementing new mechanics and gimmicks for each chapter,
				which are fitting with their themes. I'm not sure where Toby got the idea that a teacup ride
				is somehow fitting with an internet themed Dark World... but hey!
				Who's to defy the dog?
			</p>
			<p>In Andromedia, we're not trying to be the dog anyways...</p>

			<h2 class="center">More Progress...?!</h2>
			<p>
				We've made substantial progress in recreating Castle Town's mechanics and locations for the different chapters!
				At least one expansion map for Castle Town was made for Chapter 3, and we've pretty much completed the Cafe Placement
				mechanic + Dojo Challenges menu as well.
			</p>
			<p>I have to thank a few people on the Kristal server for all the help...</p>

				Some more progress we've made include... Cutscenes! Test cutscenes! Shops! Test shops! Shops that rewrite the whole UI for some reason!
				Seriously, though... we're incredibly happy with all the progress that's been done so far especially after we've spent a while without news.
			</p>
			<p>
				Burnout and lack of motivation (fueled by the stagnant wait for the official chapters) tends to hit at the worst moments and that was no different
				for our team. However, after welcoming in some more members and setting up a new production schedule, we're foreseeing this project to
				have a good amount of content soon!

			<h2 class="center">Soundtrack Update</h2>
			<p>
				Our plan going forward is to slowly revamp and remaster most of the current soundtrack, so you'll be seeing changes
				and updates of old songs. We have decided to do this because we think some tracks either don't fit the characters, sound
				extremely dated, or are just overall not a good result...
			</p>
			<p>
				After bringing in very talented musicians from the community,
				we have started this process and will be posting the new tracks on HUECYCLES's SoundCloud account (because that's where I have
				Next Pro and I can't afford another plan lol), with some "special" songs being posted on YouTube, also.

			<h2 class="center">Candleholder</h2>
			<p>
				"Alright, fine, but what about Candleholder?! Is it still on hiatus???""
			</p>
			<p>
				Candleholder will soon be returning to the main stage! In 2025, we plan on resuming our development of the game and sharing news and sneak peeks + proper devlogs with you all. There's a LOT to update ever since the hiatus started so we should get to work soon enough.
			</p>
			<p>
				The game is also going through a semi-major rewrite, and some characters will be slightly redesigned (see: Dealmaker) as well as the "Hard Mode" getting almost a full rewrite. Everyone in the team is honestly really excited to soon go back to Candleholder after so long!

				This website will go through some changes, to keep things separate from HUECYCLES's own stuff and Andromedia/Candleholder.
				You'll get some more news about this on November 18th.

          <h1>Dess H. Plays</h1>
          <p>Alright, first post here.</p>
          <p>
            Hello everyone, you can call me Dess :) I play the guitar as a hobby
            I ended up getting from my nerdy churchgoer friend. Not very fond of
            church music, but I do mess around with guitar covers every now and
            then, as well as some original pieces!
          </p>
          <p>
            May share them here if this goes well and if I'm not feeling too
            ashamed about them sounding offkey lol But if you want to request a
            song for me to cover, please leave a message!
          </p>
          <p>
            Not sure if I'll be able to post consistently, so lemme upload some
            of the stuff I have ready and make the blog pretty for now.
          </p>

            (In case I ever use a holiday related gif here, even if it's not
            holiday season, don't make a big deal about it. My sister likes it)

            To whoever messaged "Please cover Hyperdream - The Serialkillers":

            You can play guitar yourself and much better than me lmfao. Not
            happening
          </p>
          <p>
            Also that song is surprisingly hard man! My fingers are already
            calloused, I need more lessons (and more gingerbread cookies from
            your mother, they're my source of motivation)
          </p>
          <p>
            One day I'll be able to play the first half of your favorite song.
            :)

            Got "Blood Crushers The Band - Raise Up Your Bat" in my inbox today.
          </p>
          <p>Great choice and nice music taste! I'm very biased but shh</p>
          <p>
            Couldn't make a full cover since I had to meet up with some friends
            (who I kept bailing for the last few weeks). Will continue or maybe
            do another take when I come back.

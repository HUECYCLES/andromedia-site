      <h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
      <p><h3>Q: Is this a co-owned project?</h3></p>
      <p>Yes, this project is owned by both <a href="./about" onclick="clickSoundLoad(event)" onmouseenter="hoverSound()">HUECYCLES</a>
        and <a href="https://lisspeed.carrd.co/" onclick="clickSoundLoad(event)" onmouseenter="hoverSound()">Lisspeed</a> :)</p>
      <p>Please check out the full <a href="./team">team</a> behind this too!</p>

      <p><h3>Q: Will there be a fangame?</h3></p>
      <p>At the time, it's still <strong>unknown</strong> whether or not a fangame will be made. 
        Please do not constantly ask about this. If we decide to make one, we'll be sure to let everyone know!</p>
        
      <p><h3>Q: What do you use for making all the leaks, art and music?</h3></p>
      <p>We use <a href="https://kristal.cc/" onclick="clickSoundLoad(event)" onmouseenter="hoverSound()">Kristal</a>, which is a Deltarune fangame engine in beta, 
        to code most of the stuff present in the leaks. The music is done with FL Studio and all the pixel art is made in Aseprite.
        <p>As for digital art software, we use:
        <ul>
          <li>Clip Studio Paint</li>
          <li>Procreate</li>
          <li>Storyboard Pro</li>
          <li>Photoshop</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>A few bonus software include Audacity, Premiere Pro and Game Maker Studio 2 (which was used to make the old leak 
          videos in an <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/undertale_engine/378055" onclick="clickSoundLoad(event)" onmouseenter="hoverSound()">Undertale Engine</a>). 
          <a href="https://gamebanana.com/tools/6647" onclick="clickSoundLoad(event)" onmouseenter="hoverSound()">Undertale ModTool</a> may also be used a few times to directly mod stuff 
          in Undertale/Deltarune when deemed necessary.</p>

      <p><h3>Q: Can you add my character or idea to the series?</h3></p>
      <p>The Metropolis already has its own canon to follow, and the creators won't change it unless it's their decision to do so. 
        Suggesting something is fine, but please do not pester us to include it. This is our project and we have final say!</p>

      <p><h3>Q: Who makes all the music? Will the soundtrack be available on Spotify?</h3></p>
      <p>HUECYCLES used to compose all the soundtrack up until now. They're still learning a lot about music making, and they're 
        very grateful by the positive response it's been getting! Again, check out the full <a href="./team" onclick="clickSoundLoad(event)" onmouseenter="hoverSound()">team</a> behind this 
        to see who does what.</p>
      <p>As for getting the songs on Spotify, we honestly don't know, especially since it costs money to do that. We'll see.</p>

      <p><h3>Q: [Insert Detail Here] is inaccurate, or doesn't follow the storyline closely.</h3></p>
      <p>That is because it's an AU we are making for fun. We do try to be as accurate as possible to the main source (Halojack is a prime example of this), 
        but it won't be perfect everytime. Some stuff might be altered by creative liberty, while others may have stemmed from an oversight. 
        Try not to think too much about it, and if you do, avoid being harsh.</p>

      <p><h3>Q: Will you do a take on Chapters 4-7 too?</h3></p>
      <p>Nope! This is only a Chapter 3 take, and it's already big as it is, haha. We don't plan on covering the entire game.</p>

      <p><h3>Q: Which characters were made by who?</h3></p>
      <p>We will soon have a proper credits + character info page available so it's easier to follow who does what! 
        Keep checking the <a href="./ch3" onclick="clickSoundLoad(event)" onmouseenter="hoverSound()">Metropolis page</a>.</p>
        
      <p><h3>Q: Why choose Napstablook instead of Undyne?</h3></p>
      <p>We felt that having two main characters from Undertale whose stories were already explored would make Chapter 3 a bit... boring. 
        Napstablook is a side character that we'd love to flesh out or know more about, and since they're a cop, we chose to feature them 
        in The Metropolis instead.</p>
      
      <p><h3>Q: How does the whole thing about Kris's pocket work? Why do Kris, Spamton and Jevil have a different palette? How can Kris even BE inside their own pocket??</h3></p>
      <p>Once the VS Spamton and Jevil video is out, a lot of these questions will be properly answered! Seeing how it plays out is way more fun than explaining it. That being said, 
        it's not too much of a complex answer. lol</p>
      
      <p><h3>Q: Is there a Genocide/Weird Route?</h3></p>
      <p>Yes, the route is nicknamed "Stormeye Route" in the same fashion as Snowgrave. However, it plays out quite differently from Snowgrave, while still maintaining a few similar aspects. 
        We'd like to keep most details of the route a surprise, though!</p>

      <p><h3>Q: Do you fight Nick in any of the routes?</h3></p>
      <p>Yes, you can fight him in Pacifist/Neutral. He's also the hardest boss in Stormeye Route. The guy's pretty strong.</p>

      <p><h3>Q: Is Halojack any harder than Jevil or Spamton Neo?</h3></p>
      <p>Yes, she is more powerful than both of them and thus has a very challenging fight. 
        You'll also need to use the Shadow Mantle against her to win, like Seam tells us in Chapter 2's aftermath. 
        We do worry about keeping her balanced so it isn't an unfair battle.</p>

      <p><h3>Q: What items does Halojack drop?</h3></p>
      <p>Defeating her through ACTing grants you the Singazer armor, the other half of her mask, while defeating her violently gives you the Gloryslicer weapon, a giant chakram blade based on her halo. 
        Kris can equip the Gloryslicer, while the whole party can equip the Singazer.</p>

      <p><h3>Q: What are Nick and Halojack's light world equivalents?</h3></p>
      <p>Nick is Toriel's old vintage camera, where she keeps the early Dreemurr family videos, while Halojack is an old signal amplifier 
        that Toriel and Kris keep losing around the house and letting people borrow it.</p>

      <p><h3>Q: What will you do once Chapters 3-5 are out?</h3></p>
      <p>We'll justâ€¦ Keep this project as an AU. lol It's very much a passion project right now, as well as just a take on Chapter 3/TV 
        Dark World. We're very attached to these characters so we do want them around, especially if it stops being a series and 
        becomes a fangame.</p>

      <p><h3>Q: What about your take on Dess?</h3></p>
      <p>Dess is getting a bit of spotlight in Candleholder, though we're still brainstorming her presence/how strong 
        it is in The Metropolis.</p>

      <p><h3>Q: Why is A Hat in Time canon to Metropolis?</h3></p>
      <p>Primarily as a fun little Easter egg! Back when Nick was first revealed to YouTube a ton of people compared his similarities to 
        Moonjumper, despite Lisspeed never having played the game. She began to joke about it and after a while decided to make it canon to 
        Nick's backstory. Not much will be shown of them, besides a few small mentions in his backstory.</p>

      <p><h3>Q: Why give Toriel plant powers instead of fire powers? Doesn't she use fire in Undertale?</h3></p>
      <p>Undertale and Deltarune are two different universes. On top of that, many people have based her Deltarune design on a fire mage. 
        It does make her look a lot like Ralsei, which is a bit boring to us personally.</p>
      <p>So we decided to explore the nature aspect of her. She seems to enjoy gardening or plants in general, evidenced by the Ruins 
        in Undertale having a lot of autumn imagery (which is very symbolic for her character). She also has a connection to Flowey, 
        and in Deltarune, keeps throwing Asgore's flowers away. We felt it would be interesting to make her powers be tied to plants 
        and seasons, giving us more aspects of her to tap on.</p>
      
      <p><h3>Q: What is Halojack's soul mode?</h3></p>
      <p>The Cyan/Light Blue Soul, which embodies patience.</p>
      
      <p><h3>Q: What about Tenna? They seem to be the antagonist instead of Mike, will you replace Mike with Tenna?</h3></p>
      <p>NO. (Since a lot, and we mean a LOT of people asked... lol)</p>
      <p>Mike is pretty much our OC at this point, and we like our own vision for him so we're definitely maintaining it. 
        We MIGHT make a reference to Tenna especially in regards to our own theories, but having such a drastic change to The 
        Metropolis is not something we plan on doing.</p>
      <p>Mike has his own backstory and motives, and we'd love to tell that story instead of trying to be canon compliant (which is not exactly our goal).</p>

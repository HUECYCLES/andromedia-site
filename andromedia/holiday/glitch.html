                    <p>Remember Luk & Jasper III? It's absolutely one of my favorite games and by far the most nostalgic to me.</p>
                    <p>As a kid I used to stay up late while my older sister watched me try to beat the harder missions (and make sure Mom didn't come upstairs...).
                        I was too young to understand some of the more crude humor of the game, especially the jokes that came from Jasper XD
                    </p>
                    <p>It was <em>technically</em> for teens... but Dess gifted me the lasted installment in the franchise for Christmas because
                        it "looked right up my alley". So I, um... basically played the trilogy backwards?? ><</p>
                    <p>Anyway, I remember that after you talked to the big, grey statue in the shrine, you'd unlock new DAWN powers... 
                        The protagonist was going through some sort of character development and gaining DAWN abilities to balance out their DUSK half.
                        Some of these powers included moving at the speed of light as a glowing orb, or using a temporary energy shield.
                    </p>
                    <p>I got spoiled on the last power, but I WAS looking for walkthroughs to know what to do in the mirror puzzles... XP
                        The last ability gave your character magical wings and you <em>could</em> fly, but there was a limit to how much you could flap your wings.
                        You'd usually end up falling because you didn't time the flapping right.</p>
                    <p>I used to spam the button before understanding the mechanic fully, but I discovered a way to basically... fly forever in the game.</p>
                    <p>All you need to do is press the wing flap button, then BEFORE you fall, press the shield button. That ends up glitching the wing mechanic
                        and giving your character a little "up" boost. If you flap your wings RIGHT AFTER, you gain another boost, and so on. So alternating
                        between the wing flap and shield button repeatedly will make you "fly" higher and higher! It's kind of tricky to maintain constantly
                        but if you lose the rhythm, you can just start it up again before your character falls completely.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can reach almost anywhere with this glitch. Gosh, I even found an easter egg photo of the dev team behind some fake collision in Ruined Town's
                        towers. I wonder if this was intended...? Because I can't recall any other way of reaching so high up WITHOUT this glitch. Plus, it's pretty simple
                        to do, you literally just have to press two buttons!!!
                    </p>
                    <p>My sister would get angry at me for spending most of the time doing it instead of actually getting on with missions...
                        I'd whine about all the fetch quests being boring, and she would leave the room. Exploiting a glitch
                        only to explore the whole map until the textures broke seems even more boring XDDD
                    </p>
                    <p>Eventually my mom found out WHY I was always so tired in the morning, and banned me from playing video games after 10 PM. lol

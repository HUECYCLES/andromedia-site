            <p style="text-align: center">Hello, everyone! Here we are, 2 years after Andromedia
            as a project started.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Well, at least, when the infamous
            "Pocket Chatter" video was uploaded for all to see.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center">We're sure a lot of you remember this silly screen.</p>
            <p class="center"><img class="image pixelated" src="../../assets/img/newsletters/pocket_chatter.png"></p>
            <p style="text-align: center">That was the birth of what we eventually would know as
                <em>DELTARUNE: The Metropolis</em>, and today is called simply
                <em>Andromedia Chapters</em>.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center">We have to say it's been an incredible pleasure to work
                on this project and have your support. What started
                as a little "hey, what if Spamton and Jevil talked
                THROUGH your pocket" blossomed into a journey full
                of fun characters to work with and a lovely
                community to boot. And so, as a little thanks from us in the team, we
                decided to make something different! It's nothing big
                of course, but this is a special date, and so it gets a
                special little newsletter showcasing some stuff
                as well as basic information!</p>
            <h2 class="center">When will the YouTube series begin proper?</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center">HAHA... We basically dropped the first "episode" of
                Chapter 3 and entered a gigantic hiatus with
                the project. Which is... not ideal. To be fair, a LOT of things have happened in our lives
                as directors. Stuff regarding our personal lives,
                mental health, executive dysfunction... plus,
                <a href="../../candleholder">Candleholder</a> happened!
                </p>
            <p style="text-align: center">Following our team additions through the application
                period, our progress for Candleholder as a fangame
                sped through the roof, and so, Andromedia (previously
                Deltarune: The Metropolis) was cast to the side. The
                brain works in enigmatic ways, and so our focus suffered
                along... but I guess that is to be expected when you have
                TWO projects to take care of.
                </p>
            <p style="text-align: center">Currently we've got some progress down for the first episode,
                like tilesets, cutscenes and sprites. Most of it is already
                in Kristal, we just need to find the time to actually get things
                going for the video. Especially since we've been focusing on
                something special for Candleholder... which
                will be revealed soon.</p>

            <p class="center"><img class="image pixelated" src="../../assets/img/newsletters/observatory.png" width="873"></p>
            <h2 class="center">What about the other chapters?</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center">Our current plans involve the next chapters as well! We do want
                to include them in the series and we've gotten a lot done both
                for character design and music, as well as overall
                conceptualizing how each chapter will go. We're quite happy with our progress and story so far,
                even if we cannot show much of the stuff we're working on.
                Making a full 7 chapters worth of content takes time
                and patience, of course. We'll do our best however to make sure things run more
                smoothly, which might include having more people on board...</p>
            <p class="center"><img class="image pixelated" src="../../assets/img/newsletters/minions_party.png" width="212" height="148"></p>
            <h2 class="center">You'll be opening more applications?</h2>
            <h2 class="center">What type of work will you be looking for?</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center">This time around, we'll be looking for musicians,
                sprite artists/animators (who can do tilesets) and
                Kristal programmers. This is mainly for Andromedia Chapters,
                but we plan on having some people on board for Candleholder
                too (especially programmers.... programmers, please apply!!!)</p>
            <p style="text-align: center">This will happen soon (ish) once we can organize our ideas
                a bit better so that everyone knows what exactly we need.
                If you get accepted, you'll probably be reading a LOT of our
                notes and brainstorming.</p>

            <h2 class="center">And now...</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center">...it's time to actually celebrate our anniversary!
                We have sent out party invitations to a few folks who would
                certainly appreciate a bit of mischief in their lives.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center">Not that they aren't already causing some...</p>
